Back when pokemon go was a thing, in my first year of university (2020) I wanted to make something that was similar, but didn't require data to use. I made this simple location-based game instead, that maps out your local area based on where you go and generates different objects in the environment, which each have different resources that you can collect periodically.

Built with React Native.
